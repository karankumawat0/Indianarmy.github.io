            <h2>Things to see inside Hall of Fame</h2>
The Hall of Fame museum, consisting of two stories, is divided into various sections which contain several displays. In the upper floor, there is a section named OP Vijay Gallery. Here, you can see the various kinds of weapons used in the Kargil war, along with the various arms and ammunition captured by the Indian Army during the war. On the same floor, in yet another section, various kinds of apparel and amenities used by the Indian Army in the Siachen region have also been displayed. Some of these show the pictures of army posts on the glacier, living accommodation of the troops and the training process of the troops on ice walls, besides others.

If you head to another section of the same ground floor, you will find the pictures of Kargil War on the walls. The pictures provide an elaborate and fascinating account of how the Indian Army fought the war. There is also a wall named "Lest We Forget" which displays the photographs of those soldiers who laid down their lives defending our nation. It's a very moving sight to come across and reminds you of the enormous sacrifices made by our soldiers to ensure that our country is safe and secure from foreign aggression at all times.

On the same ground floor, there is also a projection room where you can watch a documentary on "Operation Vijay". One particular moving sight on this floor meets you in the form of a frame on a wall named "The Last Post". This was the letter written by Captain Vijayant Thapar to his parents some days before he attained martyrdom. Upon reading the letter, you are overcome by a profound sense of grief and pride, while your eyes well up with tears. You are reminded of the bravery and exemplary courage displayed by our soldiers while performing their service in the line of duty.

On the ground floor, there is a section which displays the history, culture and other associated facts with Ladakh. It also consists of a souvenir shop where you can buy several items including t-shirts, caps, coffee mugs and pashmina shawls, besides others. You can also get a photo shoot clad in the Ladakhi attire in the photo shop and get the prints after paying a small amount of money.

<h2>Special Note</h2>
A statue of a serene-appearing Lord Buddha stands in front of the Hall of Fame with a message that reads, "It is better to conquer yourself than to win a thousand battles. Then the victory is yours. It cannot be taken from you, not by angels or by demons, heaven or hell." The message has a very deep meaning and conveys one of the most important lessons for mankind.
